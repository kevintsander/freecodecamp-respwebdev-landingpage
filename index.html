        <h2>What is Goetta?</h2>
        <section class="content" id="about">
            Goetta is a meat-and-grain sausage or mush of German inspiration that is popular in Metro Cincinnati. It is
            primarily composed of ground meat (pork, or sausage and beef), pin-head oats and spices. It was originally a
            dish meant to stretch out servings of meat over several meals to conserve money, and is a similar dish to
            scrapple and livermush, both also developed by German immigrants.

            The dish probably originated with German settlers from the northwestern regions of Oldenburg, Hannover, and
            Westphalia who emigrated to the Cincinnati area in the 19th century. Along with Cincinnati chili and mock
            turtle soup it is, according to Cincinnati food historian Dann Woellert, one of the area's "holy trinity" of
            local specialties.
